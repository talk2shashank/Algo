Question 1:
To find the wheather two string are anagrams. I decided to checked if two strings have same ascii code.
I converted the string in character array and in same loop I converted each character into its ascii code. 
I called the helper function to the above task. Ascii codes for both the strings are compared and boolen is return if the match is successfull. 
Space complexty of the code is O(n) as I am itertating over n elements and storing the elements in the character array. 
Time complexty is also O(n) because I am interating over n elements and converting into to ascci code. 
Both the ascii codes are compared in linear time. 

Question 2:
To find the longest palindrome substrinng in a string. I itrate over the string considering each character as the center of the string. 
I check for add length and even length palindrome. 
Time complexity O(n^2) for checking the palindrome of odd length and even length in while loop. And space complexity is O(1).
